The "extras" are a collection of small or experimental extensions to the [SmSn](https://github.com/synchrony/smsn) real-time semantics and wearable computing framework.  Basically, anything not mature or central enough to belong in SmSn proper, but worth experimenting with, is here.

Contents (in roughly descending order of importance):
* **Autotactile Fabric**: a gestural interface which acts as a "second skin", responding to the same touch sensations perceived by the wearer.  Used in an RPI research project, Intelligent Sensory Substitution.
* **SmSn RFID extension**: adds UHF [RFID](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radio-frequency_identification) tag recognition powers via [Alien Technology](http://www.alientechnology.com/) readers
* **Droidspeak**: a minimal vocabulary of basic sounds for use with microcontrollers.  Yes, it's a [Star Wars reference](http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/Binary).
* **SmSn speech extension**: adds speech recognition powers
* **SmSn OpenCalais extension**: adds [OpenCalais](http://www.opencalais.com/) entity recognition powers
* **SmSn QR code extension**: adds [QR code](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QR_code) powers
* **SmSn WebDAV extension**: toward [WebDAV](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WebDAV) integration for Extend-o-Brain
* **Ardreamo**: placeholder for a sleep and dreaming wearable
